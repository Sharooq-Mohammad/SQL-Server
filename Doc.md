## Difference between Delete and Truncate

1. Transaction Log Usage:
    * DELETE: This is a logged operation, meaning each row deleted is recorded in the transaction log. This allows for the operation to be fully recoverable and roll-backable, making it safer for scenarios where transaction integrity is critical. However, because it logs each row deletion, it can be slower and more resource-intensive, especially with large data sets.
    * TRUNCATE: This operation minimally logs the deallocation of data pages in which the data resides, rather than logging individual row deletions. It is much faster for deleting large volumes of data because it uses fewer system and transaction log resources. However, the minimal logging means only the fact that the operation occurred is logged, not the individual row deletions, which affects its recoverability.

2. Recoverability:

    * DELETE: Does not automatically commit the transaction. If you run a DELETE command without explicitly beginning a transaction, it still allows for an implicit transaction. This means you can issue a ROLLBACK immediately after a DELETE command (even outside an explicit transaction block) to undo the changes, provided no other commands have been executed that would auto-commit the transaction.
    * TRUNCATE: Automatically commits the transaction once executed unless it is explicitly placed within a transaction block. This auto-commit behavior means that once a TRUNCATE command is executed, it cannot be rolled back unless it was explicitly included in a transaction block.

3. Locking Behavior
    * DELETE: Typically acquires row-level locks (unless escalated), meaning it locks the individual rows it is deleting. This can lead to longer operations if there are many rows, but it is less disruptive to other database operations.
    * TRUNCATE: Acquires a table lock, which means it locks the entire table briefly to deallocate data pages. This can be more disruptive to concurrent operations on the same table but is executed very quickly.
4. Impact on Indexes and Constraints
    * DELETE: Respects all constraints (foreign key, check, etc.) and triggers during its operation. It also maintains indexes, though this can slow down the operation as indexes must be updated for each row deletion.
    * TRUNCATE: Does not fire triggers and cannot be used when a table is referenced by a foreign key constraint. It effectively resets identity value counters unless specified otherwise with RESEED. It also quickly deallocates entire data pages, which can be more efficient for indexes on large tables.
5. Use of Identity Columns
    * DELETE: Does not reset the identity column values. If you delete rows from a table with an identity column, the identity counter is not affected.
    * TRUNCATE: Resets the identity counter by default (the counter is reset to the seed value of the column), which can be useful or problematic depending on the scenario.
6. Permissions Required
    * DELETE: Requires DELETE permissions on the table.
    * TRUNCATE: Requires ALTER table permissions because it is technically a DDL (Data Definition Language) operation, despite behaving like a DML (Data Manipulation Language) operation.
